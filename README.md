# Titanic    
Prediction of the Titanic survival rate.    

The data is obtained from the Kaggle competition:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/    


In this project we try to predict the survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic based on multiple available indicators such age the sex, and the age of a person aboard the ship.    

We analyse the relation amongst the indicators and the surivival, and from these indicators we try to engineer better features for predictions.
